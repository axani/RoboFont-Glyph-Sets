## RoboFont-Glyph-Sets
===================

A Collection of Glyph Sets to load into RoboFont

### Some things to keep in mind
* To load a set you must have a font-window open
* Loading a set deletes all created sets

### Load/Import
1. Download the preferred set(s)
2. Click the cog-icon in the left corner of the RoboFont sidebar
3. Choose "Load sets"

### Best practice
Use the "All_sets"-file and delete the sets you donÂ´t need.
